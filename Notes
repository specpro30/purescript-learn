pure language = input -> output, and has no side effects
strictly typed = compiler will check if types are the same when executing and give error (can't do 5 + "dog")
               = also implicitly typed x = "dog"
immutable data structures

array can be randomly accessed, list need to be traversed
array need to be re-writen when inserted, list only need to append for inserted
